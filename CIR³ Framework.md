# Thinkwerke CIRÂ³ Framework  
### Continuous Intelligence Â· Integration Â· Resilience  
*A Unified Compliance & Cybersecurity Framework for Utilities and Critical Infrastructure*

---

## Overview  
The **CIRÂ³ Framework** (Continuous Intelligence Â· Integration Â· Resilience) is a **strategicâ€“technical compliance model** designed by **Thinkwerke** to operationalize European cybersecurity and AI governance laws â€” including the **EU NIS2 Directive**, **EU AI Act**, and **Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)** â€” under a unified management system aligned to **ISO/IEC 27001** and **ENISA maturity guidance**.

CIRÂ³ enables organizations to **move from regulatory obligation to proactive resilience**, integrating governance, AI oversight, and product security within the same operational ecosystem.  

---

## Framework Philosophy  
The CIRÂ³ Framework is founded on three core principles:

| **Pillar** | **Purpose** | **Outcome** |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Continuous Intelligence** | Establish real-time visibility of assets, risk, and compliance posture across cloud, data, and AI systems. | Data-driven risk and compliance awareness enabling proactive decisions. |
| **Continuous Integration** | Align organizational, AI, and product-level security controls into a single operational workflow. | Unified compliance where NIS2, AI Act, and CRA controls are implemented once, reused across frameworks. |
| **Continuous Resilience** | Sustain adaptive improvement through automation, audit readiness, and human oversight (HITL). | Long-term resilience and trust, ensuring evidence-based governance and continuous regulatory alignment. |

## Architecture of the CIRÂ³ Framework

| **Layer** | **Focus Area** | **Core Components (Azure / Databricks)** | **Linked Regulations & Standards** |
|------------|----------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Governance Layer** | Risk management, policy, and accountability. | ServiceNow CMDB, Azure Policy, Purview lineage mapping. | NIS2 Art. 21(1), ISO 27001 A.5, ENISA Baseline 2023. |
| **Data & AI Layer** | AI risk, transparency, and explainability. | Unity Catalog, MLflow, AI Risk Register, SHAP/LIME explainability. | EU AI Act Arts. 9â€“15, ISO 42001, GDPR. |
| **Security & Infrastructure Layer** | Infrastructure hardening, vulnerability mgmt, access control. | Defender for Cloud, Private Link, PIM/MFA, ACR image scans. | CRA Annex Iâ€“II, NIS2 Art. 21(2)(aâ€“f). |
| **Operational Layer** | Incident, continuity, and post-market monitoring. | Sentinel, Logic Apps (24h/72h reporting), Grafana dashboards. | NIS2 Art. 23, ENISA IR Guidelines. |
| **Resilience Layer** | Continuous improvement, learning, and audit evidence. | CIRÂ³ Dashboard, automated compliance matrix, KPI tracking. | ISO 27001 A.9, ENISA Maturity Model 2024. |

## Phased Implementation Model

| **Phase** | **Objective** | **Deliverables** | **Success Indicators** |
|------------|----------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Phase 1 â€“ Continuous Intelligence** | Build visibility and baseline for compliance maturity. | - ENISA-aligned Asset Register  <br> - Risk Ownership Map  <br> - Sentinel & Purview dashboards | Clear visibility of all critical systems and data flows. |
| **Phase 2 â€“ Continuous Integration** | Implement unified technical & organizational controls. | - NIS2 + AI Act + CRA control mapping  <br> - HITL workflow definition  <br> - AI Risk Register | Shared compliance evidence across domains; reduced audit overlap. |
| **Phase 3 â€“ Continuous Resilience** | Maintain continuous monitoring, improvement, and evidence. | - ENISA-style Quarterly Reports  <br> - CIRÂ³ Compliance Dashboard  <br> - ISO 27001 Readiness Pack | Demonstrable resilience and executive-level visibility. |

## Key Benefits for Utilities / Critical Infrastructure

| **Dimension** | **Challenge** | **How CIRÂ³ Solves It** |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Governance** | Fragmented regulatory obligations (NIS2, AI Act, CRA) | Provides unified governance model integrated into ISMS. |
| **Technical Compliance** | Siloed Azure / Databricks environments without traceability | Enables end-to-end asset, data, and AI traceability. |
| **Operational Oversight** | Complex incident reporting & evidence management | Automates ENISA and authority-compliant reporting workflows. |
| **Human Accountability** | Lack of ownership or clarity in AI decisions (HITL) | Defines HITL roles, processes, and auditable evidence. |
| **Audit Readiness** | Manual compliance documentation | Provides continuous audit trails and ENISA-formatted summaries. |

---

- **Compliance Outcome:**  
  - >80% overlap with ISO 27001 controls  
  - Real-time visibility for NIS2 and AI Act compliance status  
  - CRA readiness through secure-by-design engineering and SBOM automation
