## **Who I Am**
I am a hands-on AWS Solutions Architect, Cloud Security Architect, and Information Security Manager who has evolved into a strategic consultant and executive advisor. With deep engineering experience and a strong GRC foundation, I bridge the gap between business objectives and technical execution ensuring security is not just compliant, but also an accelerator for product growth, customer trust, and market expansion.

I understand how to build and protect systems at the infrastructure level, but more importantly, I know how to translate technical outcomes into strategic business value. Whether working with C-level leadership or engineering squads, I focus on closing gaps across people, process, and technology so organisations can scale securely, pass audits confidently, and deliver products faster without compromising risk posture.

If your organisation needs someone who can design secure architectures, implement controls, give you direct reality of product and technical infrastructure, and deliver measurable outcomes, I bring this capability to operate at both hands-on technical depth and board-level strategic height and align all stakeholders toward common, security-driven business results.

## **PROFILE SUMMARY**
Information Security and Cloud Consultant with **12+ years of international experience** delivering secure digital transformation, cloud governance, and regulatory compliance programs for European and global organisations. I have worked in **full-time roles with IBM, Oracle, and OpenText**, building a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, automation, and enterprise security.

In addition to my full-time roles, I have delivered project consulting engagements in collaboration with Red Hat and Microsoft, enabling enterprises to secure multi-cloud environments, establish strong governance, and achieve cross-regional regulatory compliance. I specialise in guiding organisations through complex security transformations from zero-trust architecture and secure CI/CD pipelines to multi-geo compliance programs aligned with ISO 27001, GDPR, CIS 18 Benchmark and NIST CSF.

I help organisations embed governance, security automation, and resilience into their cloud environments, ensuring risk reduction, audit readiness, and faster delivery without operational friction.

Today, I specialise in helping organisations achieve **ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and cloud security readiness**, while embedding governance and security automation across AWS environments, Multi Cloud Environments and occationally on Azure. My approach focuses on **simplifying compliance, reducing risk, and enabling innovation—without slowing delivery or product growth.**
