## **PROFILE SUMMARY**
Information Security and Cloud Consultant with **12+ years of international experience** delivering secure digital transformation, cloud governance, and regulatory compliance programs for European and global organisations. I have worked in **full-time roles with IBM, Oracle, and OpenText**, building a strong foundation in cloud infrastructure, automation, and enterprise security.

In addition to my full-time roles, I have delivered project consulting engagements in collaboration with Red Hat and Microsoft**, enabling enterprises to secure multi-cloud environments, establish strong governance, and achieve cross-regional regulatory compliance**. I specialise in guiding organisations through complex security transformations**—from zero-trust architecture and secure CI/CD pipelines to **multi-geo compliance programs aligned with ISO 27001, GDPR, CIS 18 Benchmark and NIST CSF.

I help organisations embed governance, security automation, and resilience** into their cloud environments, ensuring risk reduction, audit readiness, and faster delivery without operational friction.

Today, I specialise in helping organisations achieve **ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and cloud security readiness**, while embedding governance and security automation across AWS environments, Multi Cloud Environments and occationally on Azure. My approach focuses on **simplifying compliance, reducing risk, and enabling innovation—without slowing delivery or product growth.**
