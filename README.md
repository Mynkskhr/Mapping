## **PROFILE SUMMARY**
Information Security and Cloud Consultant with **12+ years of experience** (career started in **May 2013**) delivering secure digital transformation, cloud governance, and regulatory compliance programs for European and global organisations. Over the course of my career, I have worked in **full-time roles at IBM, Oracle, and OpenText**, where I built a strong technical foundation across cloud platforms, enterprise infrastructure, and DevSecOps.

In addition to my full-time roles, I have also executed **consulting engagements with clients in collaboration with Red Hat and Microsoft**, helping enterprises adopt secure CI/CD practices, strengthen compliance, and accelerate their journey to the cloud. This blend of hands-on engineering and strategic advisory work enables me to support both **C-level decision-makers and technical delivery teams**.

Today, I specialise in helping organisations achieve **ISO 27001, GDPR, NIS2, DORA, and cloud security readiness**, while embedding governance and security automation across AWS environments. My approach focuses on **simplifying compliance, reducing risk, and enabling innovation‚Äîwithout slowing delivery or product growth.**
