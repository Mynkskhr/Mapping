## 🧭 2. Thinkwerke CIR³ Framework  
### *Continuous Intelligence · Integration · Resilience*

| **Phase** | **Objective** | **Core Activities** | **Deliverables** |
|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Phase 1 – Continuous Intelligence** | Establish real-time visibility into assets, risk, and data pipelines. | - Map infrastructure (Azure + Databricks) <br> - Integrate Sentinel, Purview, and Defender <br> - Create asset inventory baseline | - ENISA-aligned CMDB <br> - Asset register with risk ownership |
| **Phase 2 – Continuous Integration** | Align NIS2, AI Act, and CRA into one implementation track. | - Define NIS2 technical/organizational controls <br> - Build AI governance (HITL, model risk, explainability) <br> - Embed CRA conformity in CI/CD | - Unified compliance matrix <br> - AI conformity technical file (Annex IV) |
| **Phase 3 – Continuous Resilience** | Establish continuous improvement and response framework. | - Implement post-market monitoring <br> - Conduct restoration drills and model drift audits <br> - Create unified reporting dashboard | - CIR³ dashboard <br> - Audit-ready ENISA/ISO reports |

## 🧠 4. Compliance Maturity Chain  
### From NIS2 → AI Act → CRA → ISO 27001 → Customer Trust

| **Stage** | **Focus Area** | **Dependency / Outcome** |
|------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| **NIS2 Directive** | Secure organizational and technical foundation for essential entities. | Builds base security posture for AI and product compliance. |
| **EU AI Act** | Risk-based governance for AI transparency, bias control, and HITL oversight. | Depends on NIS2’s established security maturity. |
| **Cyber Resilience Act** | Product security, vulnerability disclosure, and software assurance. | Builds upon NIS2 (governance) and AI Act (technical controls). |
| **ISO 27001** | ISMS unifying all regulatory controls and continuous improvement. | Converts compliance into operational maturity. |
| **Customer Trust** | Demonstrable transparency, traceability, and EU readiness. | Achieved through unified compliance evidence. |

> ⚡ **Critical Insight:** Each regulation strengthens the previous one. Missing one weakens the entire chain.  
> Unified governance through the **CIR³ Framework** builds resilience, trust, and long-term EU market readiness.
