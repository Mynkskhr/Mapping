## **Who I Am**
I am a hands-on **AWS Solutions Architect, Cloud Security Architect, and Information Security Manager** who has evolved into a strategic consultant and executive advisor. With deep engineering experience and a strong GRC foundation, I bridge the gap between **business objectives and technical execution**, ensuring security is not just compliant but also an **accelerator for product growth, customer trust, and market expansion**.

I understand how to build and protect systems at the infrastructure level, but more importantly, I know how to **translate technical outcomes into business value**. Whether working with C-level leadership or engineering teams, I focus on closing gaps across people, process, and technology so organisations can scale securely, pass audits confidently, and deliver products faster without compromising risk posture.

If your organisation needs someone who can design secure architectures, implement controls, assess infrastructure realities, and deliver measurable outcomes, I bring the ability to operate at both **hands-on technical depth** and **board-level strategic height**—aligning all stakeholders toward secure, growth-oriented results and give correct reports to stakeholders about the blockers, which can be Cultural, Knowledge or Human factor.
